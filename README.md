# Unity2D-Node
Unity2D Object similar to Sprite from Cocos2dx

Not a mature tool

I.Node

Inherits from Monobehavior

How to get a Node:
1.Signify a Unity class inheriting from Node.
    
    public class GameControl : Node
    
2.Attach the script to an object to allow single uses.  

    Node node = Instantiate(prefab, position, Quaternion.Identity).GetComponent<Node>();

What it can do:
1.Run Actions like Action in cocos2dx.
2.Invoke functions as the standard "Invoke" does but allows parameters for functions, which also works for lambdas.

How it works:
  The actions and functions would be sealed in the Event class(defined as follows).
  
    using Event = System.Collections.Generic.KeyValuePair<Condition, Actions.Func>;
  
  Each Node owns an ArrayList of Events.Each item is checked every frame and executed by the preset conditions.
      
    public ArrayList events = new ArrayList();
    
  You can add events with schedule(Event evnt), in which Event can be generated by invoking the Actions class.
  
    public void schedule(Event evnt)
    {
        events.Add(evnt);
    }
  
II.Actions

Works mainly through delegate
All the methods are static

Delegates:

    public delegate void Action();
    public delegate void Func(Node node);
    public delegate bool Exit();
    public delegate Vector2 Move(float t);
    public delegate float Rotate(float t);
    
Functions:
        
    public static Event callFunc(Action action, float delay = 0f, int times = 1)
        //Invokes a function in /delay/ for /times/ times, where the action is usually a lambda.  
        
    public static Event delay(float time)
        //Do nothing for /time/, as an assistance for sequence().
    
    public static Event setVelocity(Vector2 velocity, float delay = 0f)
    public static Event setVelocity(Move move, bool resetTick = false, float delay = 0f)
        //Resets the volecity.
